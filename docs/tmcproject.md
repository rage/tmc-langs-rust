Exercises can be configured by adding an optional `.tmcproject.yml` file to the exercise root directory. Additionally, a course-wide file can be added to the course's root. When the course is then refreshed, the course-wide file is merged with the exercise-specific ones for the exercise stub and solution. For each key-value pair in the course-wide file, if the key is not present in the exercise-specific file, it is added to it with the course-wide file's value.


A course can also be configured as a whole using a `course_options.yml`-configuration file, documentation for that can be found [here](./course_options.md).

## Keys

All of the keys listed below are optional.

| Key name               | Value type                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| extra_student_files    | List of strings                                      | List of file paths relative to the exercise root directory. The files and directories will be considered to be student files which should not be modified by tmc-langs.              |
| extra_exercise_files   | List of strings                                      | List of file paths relative to the exercise root directory. The files and directories will be considered to be exercise files which can be modified by tmc-langs.                    |
| force_update           | List of strings                                      | List of file paths relative to the exercise root directory. The files and directories are overwritten by tmc-langs during the update process even if they are student files.         |
| tests_timeout_ms       | Integer                                              | The value is used to limit the running time of tests.                                                                                                                                |
| no-tests               | Boolean OR Map "points" -> List of string OR integer | If set to true or a map, the no-tests plugin is used for the exercise. If set to a list, the list will be used as the exercise's points.                                             |
| fail_on_valgrind_error | Boolean                                              | If set, the C plugin will attempt to run valgrind and fail the exercise if it discovers errors.                                                                                      |
| minimum_python_version | Python version string                                | Must be "{major}.{minor}.{patch}", "{major}.{minor}" or "{major}". If set, the Python plugin will warn the user if the Python version being used is below the given minimum version. |
| sandbox_image          | The Docker image that should be used at the sandbox. | Should be the Docker registry path of the image.                                                                                                                                     |

## Default student and exercise files

Each plugin defines some paths to be student or exercise files by default. To see the default settings for each plugin (called the plugin's _student file policy_), see each plugin's `README.md`:

- [C#](../plugins/csharp/README.md#student-file-policy)
- [Maven](../plugins/java/README.md#student-file-policy)
- [Ant](../plugins/java/README.md#student-file-policy-1)
- [Make](../plugins/make/README.md#student-file-policy)
- [No tests plugin](../plugins/notests/README.md#student-file-policy)
- [Python 3](../plugins/python3/README.md#student-file-policy)
- [R](../plugins/r/README.md#student-file-policy)
